                        Today I went to the ENT to get my ear checked out by a specialist to make sure I was finally all good to head back to San Diego. 
                        I was pretty nervous (for honestly no reason) that they were going to ask for a followup and that I would have to stay in San Jose for longer.
                         But after I passed my hearing test, they said that I was all good to go so I started packing all my stuff as soon as I got home. I have an <em>important quiz</em> 
                         to take my tomorrow at midnight that I am pretty nervous about.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Things I Need to Pack</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Clean Clothes (do laundry!)</li>
                        <li>Medications</li>

                        Today I finalized with my parents that I'm going back to San Diego tomorrow! I'm going to go with my cousin
                        who is already going there to save my parents the trip of driving down and all the way back up. I still have not taken
                        the quiz that I was nervous about yesterday because I have not finished studying.
                        <br> I still need to study:

                        Today I made the <em>long</em> drive down to San Diego with my little cousin, aunt, and uncle. My little cousin is super cute but she can be
                        a <b>lot</b> of stimulus. I tried to take a couple of naps on the way down since I had to wake up pretty early. I finally reached San Diego at
                        around 2 in the afternoon. I need to get some groceries tonight so I can cook for myself for the next couple weeks!
